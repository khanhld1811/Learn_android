    + JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format.
    + It is easy for humans to read and write
    + JSON is a text format that completely language independent.
    
    - JSON is built on two structures
        
        + A collection of name/value pairs. In variour language -> this is relized as an

                                                                    * dictionary
                                                                    * hash table
                                                                    * keyed list

        + An ordered list of values. In most languages this is realized as an -> + array
                                                                                 + vector

II . structures
    1. Object
        +   An object is an unordered set of name / value pairs.
            An object begin with {left brace and ends with } right brace.
            Each name is followe by: colon and the name/value pairs are separated by, comma.
    2.Array
        +   An array is an ordered collection of values.
            An array begin with [left bracket and ends with ] right bracket.
            Values are separated by , comma.
    3.Value
        + A value ->    * string in double quotes
                        * number
                        * true or false
                        * null
                        * object
                        * array
    4.String
        + A string is sequence of zero or more Unicode characters, ->   * wrapped in double quotes
                                                                        * backslash escapes

            "   : quoation mark
            \   : reverse solidus
            /   : solidus
            b   : backspace
            f   : formfeed
            n   : linefeed
            r   : carrigge return
            t   : horizontal table
            u   : 4 hex digits
    
    5. Number

        + Integer   : Digits 1-9, 0 and positive or negative
        + Fractions : .3, .9
        + Exponent  : e, e+, e-, E, E+, E-
